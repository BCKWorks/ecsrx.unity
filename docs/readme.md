# Docs

Here is an attempt at documentation of the framework and use-cases.

Hopefully there are topics you care about and provide you enough basic information to go on, if now however feel free to join the 
gitter room and chat some more about it in there.

There are also a number of examples within the project folders you can just look over or check out and run yourself.

## Where to start

This project contains lots of running examples, mainly based around common use cases, there is also a RogueLike2d example project for looking at.

## Reading order

There have been requests for a reading order, and while there is not really a specific route through the docs it is recommended that you learn about:

- [entities](entities.md)
- [components](components.md)
- [groups](groups.md)
- [systems](systems.md)

That covers the basic ECS paradigm and how the reactive approach lends itself to systems and processing of entities, then it is probably beneficial to look at:

- [blueprints](blueprints.md)
- [views and resolving](views-and-resolving.md)
- [game objects & entity binding](gameobject-entity-binding.md)
- [filter entities](filter-entities.md)
- [common recipies](common-recipies.md)

Rest of it is just me waffling on, going forward a lot of this documentation will be changed as the new core [EcsRx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx) changes some of the names and functionality.
